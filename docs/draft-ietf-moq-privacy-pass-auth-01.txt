1.  Introduction

   Media over QUIC (MoQ) [MoQ-TRANSPORT] provides a transport protocol
   for live and on-demand media delivery, real-time communication, and
   interactive content distribution over QUIC connections.  The protocol
   supports a wide range of applications including video streaming,
   video conferencing, gaming, interactive broadcasts, and other
   latency-sensitive use cases.  MoQ includes mechanisms for
   authorization through tokens that can be used to control access to
   media streams, interactive sessions, and relay operations.

   Traditional authorization mechanisms often lack the privacy
   protection needed for modern media distribution scenarios, where
   users' viewing patterns and content preferences should remain private
   while still enabling fine-grained access control, namespace
   restrictions, and operational constraints.

   Privacy Pass [RFC9576] provides a privacy-preserving authorization
   architecture that enables anonymous authentication through unlinkable
   tokens.  The Privacy Pass architecture consists of four entities:
   Client, Origin, Issuer, and Attester, which work together to provide
   token-based authorization without compromising user privacy.  The
   issuance protocols [RFC9578] define how these tokens are created and
   verified.

   This document defines how Privacy Pass tokens can be integrated with
   MoQ's authorization framework to provide comprehensive access control
   for media streaming, real-time communication, and interactive content
   services while preserving user privacy through unlinkable
   authentication tokens.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Privacy Pass Architecture for MoQ

   Privacy Pass Terminology defined in Section 2 of [RFC9576] is reused
   here.  The Privacy Pass MoQ integration involves the following
   entities and their interactions:

Internet-Draft            Privacy Pass MoQ Auth             October 2025


   *  *Client*: The MoQ client requesting access to media content.  The
      client is responsible for obtaining Privacy Pass tokens through
      the attestation and issuance process, and presenting these tokens
      when requesting MoQ operations.

   *  *MoQ Relay/Origin*: The MoQ relay server or origin that forwards
      media content and requires authorization.  The relay validates
      Privacy Pass tokens, enforces access policies, and forwards
      authorized requests to origins or other relays.  Relays maintain
      configuration for trusted issuers and validate token signatures
      and metadata.

   *  *Privacy Pass Issuer*: The entity that issues Privacy Pass tokens
      to clients after successful attestation.  The issuer operates the
      token issuance protocol, manages cryptographic keys.  The issuer
      creates tokens with appropriate MoQ-specific metadata.

   *  *Privacy Pass Attester*: The entity that attests to properties of
      clients for the purposes of token issuance.  The attester verifies
      client credentials, subscription status, or other eligibility
      criteria.  Common attestation methods include username/password,
      OAuth, device certificates, or other authentication mechanisms.

2.1.  Joint Attester and Issuer

   In the below deployment, the MoQ relay and Privacy Pass issuer are
   operated by different entities to enhance privacy through separation
   of concerns.  This corresponds to Section 4.4 of [RFC9576].

   +-----------+            +--------+         +----------+ +--------+
   | MoQ Relay |            | Client |         | Attester | | Issuer |
   +-----+-----+            +---+----+         +----+-----+ +---+----+
         |                      |                   |           |
         |<------ Request ------+                   |           |
         +--- TokenChallenge -->|                   |           |
         |                      |<== Attestation ==>|           |
         |                      |                   |           |
         |                      +--------- TokenRequest ------->|
         |                      |<-------- TokenResponse -------+
         |<--- Request+Token ---+                   |           |
         |                      |                   |           |

             Figure 1: Separated Issuer and Relay Architecture

   In certain deployments the MoQ relay and Privacy Pass issuer may be
   operated by the same entity to simplify key management and policy
   coordination.  This is the Privacy Pass deployment described in
   Section 4.2 of [RFC9576].

2.2.  Shared Origin, Attester, Issuer with a Reverse Flow

   The flow described above can be used to bootstrap a shared origin-
   attester-issuer flow, as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC9576].  The
   MoQ relay plays all role, allowing it to use privately verifiable
   token types registered in [PRIVACYPASS-IANA].

   In this scenario, the MoQ relay origin would accept tokens signed by
   two issuers:

   1.  Type 0x0002 token signed by the bootstrap issuer from Section 2.1

   2.  Type 0x0001, 0x0005, or 0xE5AC tokens signed by its own issuer.

   With [PRIVACYPASS-ARC], the flow would look as follow

+----------------------------------.                          +--------------------------.
|  +---------------+ +-----------+  |         +--------+      |  +----------+ +--------+  |
|  | Origin Issuer | | MoQ Relay |  |         | Client |      |  | Attester | | Issuer |  |
|  +---+-----------+ +-----+-----+  |         +---+----+      |  +----+-----+ +---+----+  |
 `-----|-------------------|-------'              |            `------|-----------|------'
       |                   |                      |<-------- TokenResponse -------+
       |                   |<---- Request    -----+                   |           |
       |                   |     +Token           |                   |           |
       |                   |     +TokenRequestO   |                   |           |
       |<- TokenRequestO --+                      |                   |           |
       +- TokenResponseO ->|                      |                   |           |
       |                   +----- Response     -->|                   |           |
       |                   |     +TokenResponseO  |                   |           |
       |                   |                      |                   |           |

   TokenRequestO and TokenResponseO are part of a reverse flow.  The
   client request a new token/credential to the origin.  It allows the
   client to exchange its initial 0x0002 Token against a privately
   verifiable token issued by the origin.

   TokenRequestO should correspond to the associated privately
   verifiable token definition.  These are listed in Section 3.1.

   All privately verifiable scheme allow to amortise token issuance
   cost, making them more compelling in a streaming case.  This is
   specified in Section 5 of [PRIVACYPASS-BATCHED].

   When using 0xE5AC, TokenRequestO is a CredentialRequest defined in
   Section 7.1 of [PRIVACYPASS-ARC].

2.3.  Trust Model

   The architecture assumes the following trust relationships based on
   Section 3 of [RFC9576]:

   *  Issuer and attesters do not collude to guarantee unlinkability
      properties

   *  Relays trust issuers to properly validate client eligibility
      before issuing tokens

   *  Issuers trust attesters to accurately verify client eligibility

3.  Privacy Pass Token Integration

   This section describes how Privacy Pass tokens are integrated into
   the MoQ transport protocol to provide privacy-preserving
   authorization for various media operations.

3.1.  Token Types for MoQ Authorization

   This specification uses the below existing Privacy Pass token types:

   *Publicly verifiable token types*

   *  0x0002 (Blind RSA (2048-bit)): Defined in Section 6 of [RFC9578].
      Uses blind RSA signatures ([RFC9474]) for deployments requiring
      distributed validation across multiple relays.

   *Privately verifiable token types*

   *  0x0001 (VOPRF(P-384, SHA-384)): Defined in Section 6 of [RFC9578].
      Uses VOPRF ([RFC9497]) for deployments where the origin is the
      issuer.  Issuance can be batched as defined in Section 5 of
      [PRIVACYPASS-BATCHED].

   *  0x0005 (VOPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512)): Defined in Section 8.1 of
      [PRIVACYPASS-BATCHED].  Uses VOPRF ([RFC9497]) for deployments
      where the origin is the issuer.  Issuance can be batched as
      defined in Section 5 of [PRIVACYPASS-BATCHED].

   *  0xE5AC (ARC(P-256)): Anonymous Rate Limit Credentials Token using
      [ARC].  Tokens are presented by clients based on an issued
      credential and up to a presentation_limit.

Internet-Draft            Privacy Pass MoQ Auth             October 2025


3.2.  Token Structure

   Privacy Pass tokens used in MoQ MUST follow the structure defined in
   Section 2.2 of [RFC9577] for the PrivateToken HTTP authentication
   scheme.  The token structure includes:

   *  *Token Type*: 2-byte identifier specifying the issuance protocol
      used

   *  *Nonce*: 32-byte client-generated random value for uniqueness

   *  *Challenge Digest*: 32-byte SHA-256 hash of the TokenChallenge

   *  *Token Key ID*: Variable-length identifier for the issuer's public
      key

   *  *Authenticator*: Variable-length cryptographic proof bound to the
      token

3.2.1.  Token Challenge Structure for MoQ

   MoQ-specific TokenChallenge structures use the default format defined
   in Section 2.1 of [RFC9577] with MoQ-specific parameters in the
   origin_info field:

   struct {
       uint16_t token_type;
       opaque issuer_name<1..2^16-1>;
       opaque redemption_context<0..32>;
       opaque origin_info<0..2^16-1>;
   } TokenChallenge;

   For MoQ usage, the origin_info field contains MoQ-specific
   authorization scope information encoded as a UTF-8 string with the
   following format:

      TODO: Define origin_info to be binary format using TLS
      presentation language For anonymous credentials, it would make a
      lot more sense to use redemption_context instead of origin_info,
      as redemption_context is decided upon at presentation time rather
      than at issuance time.  Question that I don't have the answer yet:
      are 32-bytes enough? we might need to say something like "first 2
      bytes represent the type of rule, then data"

   moq-scope = operation ":" namespace-pattern [":" track-pattern]
   operation = "subscribe" / "fetch" / "publish" / "announce"
   namespace-pattern = exact-match / prefix-match
   track-pattern = exact-match / prefix-match
   exact-match = namespace/name-string
   prefix-match = namespace/name-string"*"

   Examples:

   *  subscribe:sports.example.com/live/* - Subscribe to any track under
      live sports

   *  fetch:vod.example.com/movies/action* - Fetch video-on-demand
      action content

   *  publish:meetings.example.com/meeting/m123/audio/opus48000 -
      Publish content for meeting m123

3.3.  Track Namespace and Track Name Matching Rules

   This specification defines prefix-based matching rules for track
   namespaces and track names to enable fine-grained access control
   while maintaining privacy.

3.3.1.  Namespace Matching

   Track namespace matching supports three modes:

   *Exact Match*:

   *  Pattern: "example.com/live/sports/soccer"

   *  Matches: Only the exact namespace example.com/live/sports/soccer

   *Prefix Match*:

   *  Pattern: "example.com/live/sports/*"

   *  Matches: Any namespace starting with example.com/live/sports/

   *  Examples: example.com/live/sports/soccer, example.com/live/sports/
      tennis

3.3.2.  Track Name Matching

   Track name matching within authorized namespaces follows the same
   pattern:

Internet-Draft            Privacy Pass MoQ Auth             October 2025


   *Exact Match*:

   *  Pattern: "video"

   *  Matches: Only tracks named exactly video

   *Prefix Match*:

   *  Pattern: "video*"

   *  Matches: Any track name starting with video

   *  Examples: video-med, video-high, video-low

3.3.3.  Matching Algorithm

   When a MoQ relay receives a request with a Privacy Pass token, it
   performs the following validation steps to determine whether to
   authorize the requested operation:

   1.  Extract the Privacy Pass token from the MoQ control message
       (SETUP, SUBSCRIBE, FETCH, PUBLISH, or ANNOUNCE)

   2.  Verify the token signature using the appropriate issuer public
       key based on the token type:

       *  For Token Type 0x0001 (VOPRF(P-384, SHA-384)): Use the
          issuer's private validation key

       *  For Token Type 0x0002 (Blind RSA(2048 bits)): Use the issuer's
          public verification key

   3.  Validate that the token has not been replayed by checking:

       *  Token nonce uniqueness within the issuer's replay window

       *  Token expiration timestamp (if present in token metadata)

   4.  Extract the MoQ-specific authorization scope from the token's
       origin_info field:

       *  Authorized operation type (subscribe, fetch, publish,
          announce)

       *  Namespace pattern (exact match or prefix match)

       *  Track name pattern (exact match or prefix match, optional)

Internet-Draft            Privacy Pass MoQ Auth             October 2025


   5.  Verify that the requested MoQ operation matches the operation
       specified in the token scope:

       *  SUBSCRIBE operations require "subscribe" scope

       *  FETCH operations require "fetch" scope

       *  PUBLISH operations require "publish" scope

       *  ANNOUNCE operations require "announce" scope

   6.  Apply namespace/name matching rules based on the pattern type:

       *  If Exact Match, the requested namespace/name MUST exactly
          equal the pattern

       *  If Prefix Match, the requested namespace/name MUST start with
          the pattern prefix

   Access is granded to the requested resource if and only if ALL of the
   following conditions are met:

   *  Token signature verification succeeds

   *  Token nonce has not been previously used (replay protection)

   *  Token has not expired (if applicable)

   *  Requested operation matches token operation scope

   *  Requested namespace matches token namespace pattern

   *  Requested track name matches token track name pattern (if
      specified) specified)

   else, authorzation error is returned to the requesting client.

3.4.  Token in MOQ Messages

   Privacy Pass tokens are provided to MoQ relays using the existing MoQ
   authorization framework with the following adaptations:

3.4.1.  SETUP Message Authorization

   For connection-level authorization, Privacy Pass tokens are included
   in the SETUP message's authorization parameter:

   SETUP {
       Version = 1,
       Parameters = [
           {
               Type = AUTHORIZATION,
               Value = base64url(PrivateTokenAuth)
           }
       ]
   }

   struct {
       uint8_t auth_scheme = 0x01; // Privacy Pass
       opaque token_data<1..2^16-1>;
   } PrivateTokenAuth;

3.4.2.  MoQ Operation-Level Authorization

   For individual MoQ operation authorization, tokens are included in
   operation-specific control messages:

   SUBSCRIBE {
       Track_Namespace = "sports.example.com/live/soccer",
       Track_Name = "video",
       Parameters = [
           {
               Type = AUTHORIZATION,
               Value = base64url(PrivateTokenAuth)
           }
       ]
   }

4.  Example Authorization Flow

   Below shows an example deployment scenarios where the relay has been
   configured with the necessary validation keys and content policies,
   the relay can verify Privacy Pass tokens locally and deliver media
   directly without contacting the Issuer.  This uses token with public
   verifiability.
