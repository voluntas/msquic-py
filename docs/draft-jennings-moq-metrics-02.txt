                           Metrics over MOQT
                       draft-jennings-moq-metrics-02

Abstract

   This document specifies how to send metrics type information over the
   Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT).

   Many systems produce significant volumes of metrics which either are
   not all needed at the same time for consumption by collection/
   aggregation endpoints or may also compete for bandwidth with the
   primary application, thus exacerbating congestion conditions
   especially in low-bandwidth networks.  Delivering these over
   architectures enabled by publish/subscribe transport like Media Over
   QUIC Transport (MOQT) [I-D.ietf-moq-transport], allows metrics data
   to be prioritized within the congestion context of the primary
   application as well as enabling local nodes to cache the metric value
   to be later retrieved via new subscriptions.

1.  Introduction

   Systems often run into the problem when the network bandwidth for
   metrics is shared with the realtime media which impacts the media
   quality.  This is especially true for realtime systems wherein
   metrics compete with bandwidth for media resulting in reduction of
   the available peak bandwidth for the primary application and often
   cause congestion in low-bandwidth networks.  There is a desire to
   transport the metrics data at an appropriate priority level over the
   same transport as the application media.  This allows the metrics
   data to take advantage of times when the media bitrate is below the
   peak rate while not impacting the peak rate available for media.

   Publishing metrics over architectures enabled via MOQT provides
   additional benefits of leveraging MOQT Relays as caches to store
   metrics in local nodes.  This allows limiting the volume of data to
   sent to the metrics collectors or aggregator.  Instead, metrics that
   are frequently collected and reported can be cached in local nodes
   and a new subscription can fetch only the metrics that are needed.
   This allows for a "just in time" delivery of metrics.

   This document specifies how to send metrics type information over the
   Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT).

   TODO: Define ABNF.

   The devices or systems publishing the metrics are referred to as
   "Resources" and have an unique "ResourceID".

   Each metric reported by an Resource has an associated timeseries.  A
   metric's timeseries is time ordered set of values (observations at
   points in time) for the corresponding metric.  Metric names are
   represented as strings and may contain ASCII letters, digits,
   underscores, and colon.  A metric's value can be one of "Gauge" or
   "Counter".  The "Gauge" value type represents a scalar value that
   always represents the current value being measured.  The "Counter"
   value type is a cumulative value that represents a single
   monotonically increasing value that can increase or be reset to zero
   on restart.  The Gauge and Counter can represent either a 64-bit
   floating point value or a 64-bit integer value.

   Resources also define zero or more Attributes.  Attributes capture
   the dimensional data to identify any given combination of them for
   the metrics reported by the resource.  Attributes are represented as
   key-value pairs and represented as strings.

   The data model specified in this section is consistent with the
   "OpenTelemetry Specification 1.34.0" [otel] for metrics when at rest
   (also known as Timeseries model).  See section Section 3 for
   streaming model where MOQT is used for transporting the metric data.

2.1.  ResourceID

   Each resource that creates metrics has a unique "ResourceID".  This
   is created by taking the MAC address of the primary network interface
   in binary, computing the sha1 hash of it, and truncating to lower 64
   bits.  Note the sha1 does not provide any security properties, it is
   just a hash that is widely implemented in hardware.  If this is not
   possible, any other random stable 64 bit identifier may be used.  The
   advantage of us MAC address is that many other management systems use
   this address and it makes it easier to correlate.  The disadvantage
   is that it reveals the MAC address.

3.  Metrics and MOQT

   This section maps the metrics data model defined in this
   specification to MOQT Object model (as defined in section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-moq-transport]).  The core idea is, the URLs for the MOQT
   objects are setup such that a subscriber could subscribe to each
   resource reporting metrics separately, and could pick the right
   metrics level in the subscriptions.

   The Track Namespace consisting of following tuples
   (moq://metrics.moq.arpa/v1/),(resourceID) is defined in this
   specification.  The track name identifies the granularity level for
   the metrics being published by the resourcce.  Thus, a track name can
   be identified with the tuple (<granularity-level>) and the full track
   name having the following format (when represented as a string):

   moq://metrics.moq.arpa/metrics-v1/<resourceID>/<level>

   Following granularity levels are defined in this specification, along
   with their associated track names.

   1.  Emergency : 0
   2.  Alert : 1
   3.  Critical : 2
   4.  Error : 3
   5.  Warning : 4
   6.  Notice : 5
   7.  Informational : 6
   8.  Debug : 7

   Mapping of metrics and its reporting frequency at the aforementioned
   levels by a resource is application defined.  However, it can be
   typical of an implementation to report metrics that represent
   aggregation of values over larger time intervals or that represent
   erroneous conditions, to use granularity that is one of Emergency,
   Alert, Critical and Error.  Such metrics have characteristics of
   being less frequent and hence consume lesser bandwidth.  Metrics that
   are captured more frequently and capture detailed view of system
   being measured typically are reported at granularity level of Warning
   and above.  Such metrics, however, consumes high bandwidth when
   published.

   The MOQT group ID identifies point in time when a given set of
   metrics were captured by the resource.  Group ID, thus represents
   capture time as number of milliseconds since "1 Jan 1972" using NTP
   Era zero conventions and truncated to 62 bit integer.  The first
   object, with MOQT object ID of 0 captures 2 pieces of information:

   1.  The capture timestamp as UNIX Epoch time in nanoseconds since
       00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

   2.  One or more attributes scoped to a given resource specified in
       the track name.  This field is optional and if omitted, the
       attribute values correspond to the most recent object 0 that had
       any attribute values.

   The subsequent objects (Object ID 1 and so on) each capture a metric
   name and the corresponding value observed at the time provided in the
   object with the object ID of 0.  The metric name field is optional
   and if omitted, the metric name from the object with same object ID
   seen in the most recent group is considered.

   Below is a conceptual representation of the MOQT mapping for a
   resource whose resourceID is "resource-1" and granularity level of
   "warning (4)".

3.1.  Examples

   Here is an example of Object ID 0 data when represented in JSON
   format [RFC8259].

   Group 1, Object ID 0
   {
     "capture_timestamp": 1720367991,
     "attributes": [ { "location": "us-east-2"}, {"os": "ubuntu20.4" }]
   }

   Here is an example of Object ID 1 and 2 data showing
   cpu_usage_percent and cpu_temperature metric values represented in
   JSON format [RFC8259].

   Group 1, Object ID 1
   {
     "metric_name": "cpu_usage_percentage",
     value: 99
   }

   Group 1,  Object ID 2
   {
     "metric_name": "cpu_temperature",
     "value": 45.1
   }

   Below is another example that shows Group 2 data as continuation from
   the previous examples, where the redundant information is omitted.

   Group 2, Object ID 0
   {
     "capture_timestamp": 1720369102, // attributes are not repeated
   }

   Group 2, Object ID 1
   {
     "value": 78 // metric_name corresponds to cpu_usage_percentage
   }

   Group 2, Object ID 2
   {
     "value": 21, // metric_name correspons to cpu_temperature
   }

   See Section 2 for details on data types representations for capture
   timestamp, attributes, metric names and values.
