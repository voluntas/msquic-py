1.  Introduction

   This draft introduces a token-based authentication scheme for use
   with MOQT [MoQTransport].  The scheme protects access to the relay
   during session establishment and also contrains the actions which the
   client may take once connected.

   This draft defines version 1 of this specification.

1.1.  Overview of the authentication workflow

   *  An end-user logs-in to a distribution service.  The service
      authenticates the user (via username/password, OAuth, 2FA or
      another method).  The methods involved in this authentication step
      lie outside the scope of this draft.

   *  Based upon the identity and permissions granted to that end-user,
      the service generates a token.  A token is a data structure that
      has been serialized into a byte array.  The token encodes
      information such as the user's ID, constraints on how and when
      they can access the MOQT distribution network and contraints on
      the actions they can take once connected.  The token may be signed
      to make it tamper-resistent.

   *  The token is given in the clear to the end-user, along with a URL
      to connect to the edge relay of a MOQT distribution network.  The
      edge relay is part of a trusted MOQT distribution network.  It has
      previously shared secrets with the distribution service, so that
      this relay is entitled to decrypt related tokens and to validate
      signatures.

   *  The end-user client application provides the token to the MOQT
      distribution relay when it connects.  This connection may be
      established over WebTransport or raw QUIC.

   *  The relay decrypts the token upon receipt and validates the
      signature.  Based upon claims conveyed in the token, the relay
      accepts or rejects the connection.

   *  If the relay accepts the connection, then the client will take a
      series of MOQT actions: ANNOUNCE, SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES, SUBSCRIBE
      or FETCH.  For each of these, it will supply the token it received
      using the AUTHENTICATION parameter.

   *  As an alternative to this workflow, the distribution service may
      vend multiple tokens to the client.  The client may use one of
      those tokens to establish the initial conneciton and others to
      authenticate its actions.

2.  Token format

   This draft uses a single token format, namely the Common Access Token
   (CAT) [CAT].  The token is supplied as a byte array.  When it must be
   cast to a string for inclusion in a URL, it is Base64 encoded
   [BASE64].

   To provide control over the MOQT actions, this draft defines a new
   CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claim called "moqt".  Use of the moqt claim is
   optional for clients.  Support for processing the moqt claim is
   mandatory for relays.

   The default for all actions is "Blocked" and this does not need to be
   communicated in the token.  As soon as a token is provided, all
   actions are explicitly blocked unless explicitly enabled.

2.1.  moqt claim

   The "moqt" claim is defined by the following CDDL:

   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= (moqt-label => moqt-value)
   moqt-label = TBD_MOQT
   moqt-value = [ + moqt-scope ]
   moqt-scope = [ moqt-actions, moqt-ns-match, moqt-track-match ]
   moqt-actions = [ + moqt-action ]
   moqt-action = int
   moqt-ns-match = bin-match
   moqt-track-match = bin-match

   bin-match = {
     ? exact-match ^ => bstr,
     ? prefix-match ^ => bstr,
     ? suffix-match ^ => bstr,
     ? contains-match ^ => bstr,
   }

   / match labels defined in CTA-5007-B 4.6.1 /
   exact-match = 0
   prefix-match = 1
   suffix-match = 2
   contains-match = 3

   The "moqt" claim bounds the scope of MOQT actions for which the token
   can provide access.  It is an array of action scopes.  Each scope is
   an array with three elements: an array of integers that identifies
   the actions, a match object for the namespace, and a match object for
   the track name.

   The actions are integers defined as follows:

        +---------------------+-----+-----------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   The scope of the moqt claim is limited to the actions provided in the
   array.  Any action not present in the array is not authorized by moqt
   claim.

   The match object is defined to be a binary form of the match object
   defined in [CAT] Section 4.6.1.  The regex and hash match types are
   not defined for use with binary values in this document.

   The first match operation is performed against the namespace and the
   second against the track name (as defined in Section 2.4.1 of {draft-
   ietf-moq-transport}).  Since the match is not being performed against
   a URI, no normalization is performed and the matches are performed
   against the entire string.  An empty match object is a legal
   construct that matches all names.

2.1.2.  Multiple actions

   Multiple actions may be communicated within the same token, with
   different permissions.  This can be facilitated by the logical claims
   defined in [Composite] or simply by defining multiple limits,
   depending on the required restrictions.  In both cases, the order in
   which limits are declared and evaluated is unimportant.  The
   evaluation stops after the first acceptable result is discovered.

2.1.2.1.  Example of evaluating multiple actions in the same token:

{
    /moqt/ TBD_MOQT: [
        [/PUBLISH/ 6, { /exact/ 0: 'example.com'}, { /prefix/ 1: 'bob'}],
        [/PUBLISH/ 6, { /exact/ 0: 'example.com'}, { /exact/ 0: 'logs/12345/bob'}]
    ],
    /exp/ 4: 1750000000
}

   *  (1) PUBLISH (Allow with a prefix match) example.com/bob

   *  (2) PUBLISH (Allow with an exact match) example.com/logs/12345/bob

   Evaluating "example.com/bob/123" would succeed on test 1 and test 2
   would never be evaluated.  Evaluating "example.com/logs/12345/bob"
   would fail on test 1 but then succeed on test 2.  Evaluating
   "example.com" would fail on test 1 and on test 2.

   In addition, the entire token expires at 2025-05-02T21:57:24+00:00.

2.1.2.2.  Example of evaluating multiple actions with related claims:

   If there are other claims that depend on which MOQT limit applies, a
   logical claim is required:

{
    /or/ TBD_OR: [
        {
            /moqt/ TBD_MOQT: [[/PUBLISH/ 6, { /exact/ 0: 'example.com'}, { /prefix/ 1: 'bob'}]],
            /exp/ 4: 1750000000
        },
        {
            /moqt/ TBD_MOQT: [[/PUBLISH/ 6, { /exact/ 0: 'example.com'}, { /exact/ 0: 'logs/12345/bob'}]],
            /exp/ 4: 1750000600
        }
    ]
}

   This provides access to the same tracks as the previous example, but
   in this case, the token is valid for publishing logs up to 10 minutes
   after the time at which the publishing of the bob track expires.

   DISCUSS: Because tokens are designed for instantanous evaluation,
   they naturally only evaluate to an "acceptable" or an "unacceptable".
   It's somewhat tricky to turn an evaluation into a complete bound on
   any particular value.  The CAT has a number of claims about the
   context of the request that can change while the stream is open.  The
   most obvious of these is the expiration time.  The "catnip" (Network
   IP) and geographic claims can also change mid-stream if the
   connection is migrated or the client moves.  Do we need to do
   something special to require periodic re-evalution?

2.2.  moqt-reval claim

   The "moqt-reval" claim is defined by the following CDDL:

   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= (moqt-reval-label => moqt-reval-value)
   moqt-reval-label = TBD_MOQT_REVAL
   moqt-reval-value = number

   The "moqt-reval" claim indicates that the token must be revalidated
   for ongoing streams.  If the token is no longer acceptable, the
   actions authorized by it MUST not be permitted to continue.

   The "moqt-reval-value" is a revalidation interval, expressed in
   seconds.  It provides an upper bound on how long a token may be
   considered acceptable for an ongoing stream.  A revalidator MAY
   revalidate sooner.

   If the revalidation interval is smaller than the recipient is
   prepared or able to revalidate, the recipient MUST reject the token.
   If a recipient is unable to revalidate tokens, it MUST reject all
   tokens with a "moqt-reval" claim.

   A token can be revalidated by simply validating it again, just as if
   it were new.  However, since some claims, signatures, MACs, and other
   attributes that could contribute to unacceptability may be incapable
   of changing acceptability in the duration, a revalidator may optimize
   by skipping some of the checks as long as the outcome of the
   validation is the same.  Revalidators SHOULD skip reverifying MACs
   and signatures when the list of acceptable issuer keys is unchanged.

   When the value of this claim is zero, the token MUST NOT be
   revalidated.  This is the default behaviour when the claim is not
   present.

   This claim MUST NOT be used outside of a base claimset.  If used
   within a composition claims, the token is not well-formed.

   The claim key for this claim is TBD_MOQT_REVAL and the claim value is
   a number.  Recipients MUST support this claim.  This claim is
   OPTIONAL for issuers.

3.  DPoP Integration with CAT for MOQT

   This section defines the use of CAT's Demonstrating Proof of
   Possession (DPoP) claims [DPoP] to enhance security in MOQT
   environments.  This approach leverages the CAT token's "cnf"
   (confirmation) claim with JWK Thumbprint binding and the "catdpop"
   (CAT DPoP Settings) claim to provide proof-of-possession capabilities
   that prevent token theft and replay attacks in MOQT systems.

3.1.  CAT DPoP Claims for MOQT

   This proposal extends the CAT authentication model by binding tokens
   to client cryptographic key pairs.  To enable sender-constrained
   token usage, the CAT tokens include DPoP-related claims as defined
   [CAT] Section 4.8, ensuring that only the legitimate token holder can
   use the token for MOQT operations.

3.1.1.  Confirmation (cnf) Claim with JWK Thumbprint

   DPoP binding is accomplished by providing the "cnf" claim with the
   "jkt" (JWK Thumbprint) confirmation method.

   Below is an exmaple showing jkt token binding.

     },
     / exp /
     4: 1750000000
   }

   Implementation Requirements:

   *  Relay Validation: MOQT relays MUST verify that DPoP proofs are
      signed with the private key corresponding to the "jkt" value

   *  Proof Binding: Relays MUST reject requests where DPoP proof
      validation or key binding fails

   *  Processing Semantics: Relays MUST process DPoP proofs as Protected
      Resource Access requests per [DPoP] Section 7

3.1.2.  DPoP Extension with Application-Agnostic Proof Framework

   This section defines the use of DPoP with an application-agnostic
   proof framework as specified in [DPOP-PROOF], which extends the
   traditional HTTP-centric DPoP model to support arbitrary protocols
   including MOQT.  This approach replaces HTTP-specific claims with a
   flexible authorization context structure that can accommodate
   protocol-specific command representations.

   The DPoP proof JWT follows the structure defined in Section 4 of
   [DPOP-PROOF] with the following required claims:

   *  "typ": "dpop-proof+jwt"

   *  "alg": Asymmetric signature algorithm identifier

   *  "jwk": Public key for verification

   JWT Payload:

   *  "jti": Unique identifier for the JWT

   *  "iat": Issued-at time

   *  "actx": Authorization Context object

   For MOQT operations, the Authorization Context ("actx") object
   contains:

   *  "type": "moqt" (registered identifier for MOQT protocol)

   *  "action": MOQT action identifier

   *  "tns": Track namespace (required)

   *  "tn": Track name (required)

   *  "resource": MOQT resource identifier (optional)

   When the optional "resource" parameter is included, it MUST be
   consistent with the "tns" and "tn" parameters.  The resource URI
   should follow the format moqt://<relay-
   endpoint>?tns=<namespace>&tn=<track> where the tns and tn query
   parameters match the respective "tns" and "tn" fields in the
   Authorization Context.

   Example DPoP proof for MOQT ANNOUNCE operation:

                                  Table 2

   Relays supporting this application-agnostic DPoP framework MUST:

   *  Validate DPoP proofs according to [DPOP-PROOF]

   *  Verify that the "actx.type" is "moqt" for MOQT operations

   *  Validate that the "actx.action" matches the requested MOQT action

   *  Verify that the "actx.tns" corresponds to the target track
      namespace

   *  Verify that the "actx.tn" corresponds to the target track name

   *  If present, verify the "actx.resource" is consistent with "tns"
      and "tn"

   *  Reject requests where Authorization Context validation fails

3.1.3.  MOQT Resource URI Construction

   The Authorization Context "resource" field should specify track
   namespace (tns) and track name (tn) parameters for MOQT resources:

   *  Connection setup: moqt://<relay-endpoint>

   *  Namespace operations: moqt://<relay-endpoint>?tns=<namespace>

   *  Track operations: moqt://<relay-
      endpoint>?tns=<namespace>&tn=<track>

3.2.  DPoP Proof Process and Token Binding Flow

   The following process illustrates how DPoP proof provision results in
   CAT token binding and subsequent MOQT relay validation:

   Steps 1-5 Detail:

   1.  Client Key Generation: The MOQT client generates an asymmetric
       key pair (typically EC P-256) for DPoP operations

   2.  Authentication with Public Key: Client authenticates with the
       authorization server, providing user credentials and the public
       key

   3.  User Authentication: Authorization server validates user identity
       and permissions

   4.  CAT Token Generation: Server creates a CAT token containing:

       *  "cnf" claim: JWK Thumbprint ("jkt") of the client's public key
          (32-byte SHA-256 hash)

   Steps 6-11 Detail:

   1.  DPoP Proof Creation: For each MOQT action, the client creates a
       fresh DPoP proof JWT with:

       *  Header: typ: "dpop-proof+jwt", alg, jwk (public key)

       *  Claims: jti (unique ID), iat (timestamp), actx (Authorization
          Context with type, action, tns, tn)

   2.  MOQT Request: Client sends MOQT action with both CAT token and
       fresh DPoP proof

   3.  CAT Token Validation: Relay validates:

       *  Token signature using shared secret with authorization server

       *  Token expiration time

       *  "moqt" claim scope for requested action

   4.  DPoP Proof Validation: Relay performs:

       *  Extract "jkt" (JWK Thumbprint) from CAT token's "cnf" claim

       *  Verify DPoP JWT signature using embedded public key

       *  Confirm that SHA-256 hash of DPoP public key matches "jkt"
          value

       *  Check proof freshness within "catdpop" window settings

       *  Process replay protection based on "jti" settings

Internet-Draft                 CAT-4-MOQT                 September 2025


       *  Validate Authorization Context ("actx") according to
          [DPOP-PROOF]

       *  Verify "actx.type" is "moqt"

       *  Validate "actx.action" matches the requested MOQT action

       *  Verify "actx.tns" and "actx.tn" correspond to target resources

   5.  Action Authorization: Relay validates the specific MOQT action
       against token scope and namespace/track permissions

   6.  Response: Relay responds with success or appropriate error
       information

4.  Adding a token to a URL

   Any time an application wishes to add a CAT token to a URL or path
   element, the token SHOULD first be Base64 encoded [BASE64].  The
   syntax and method of modifying the URL is left to the application to
   define and is not constrained by this specification.

5.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO Add security considerations for DPoP Claims

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will register the following claims in the "CBOR Web Token (CWT)
   Claims" registry:
